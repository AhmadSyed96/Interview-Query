You have been given a table  `tbl_numbers`  with only one column:  `int_numbers`. It can have one integer number value per row in a sequential manner.

Write a query to return the number repeated by one times its own value.

For example, the integer number 5 would appear five times in the output (1 times 5).

**Example:**

**Input:**

`tbl_numbers`  table


| int_numbers |
|-------------|
|           1 |
|           2 |
|           3 |
|           4 |



**Output:**



| seq_numbers |
|-------------|
|           1 |
|           2 |
|           2 |
|           3 |
|           3 |
|           3 |
|           4 |
|           4 |
|           4 |
|           4 |
