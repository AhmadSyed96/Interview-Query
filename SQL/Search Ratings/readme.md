You’re given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook. The  `query`  column is the search term, the  `position`  column represents each position the search result came in, and the  `rating`  column represents the human rating of the search result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`search_results`  table

|  Column   |  Type   |
|-----------|---------|
| query     | VARCHAR |
| result_id | INTEGER |
| position  | INTEGER |
| rating    | INTEGER |



1.  Write a query to compute a metric to measure the quality of the search results for each query.
    
2.  You want to be able to compute a metric that measures the precision of the ranking system based on position. For example, if the results for dog and cat are…
    


| query | result_id | position | rating |       notes       |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| dog   |      1000 |        1 |      2 | picture of hotdog |
| dog   |       998 |        2 |      4 | dog walking       |
| dog   |       342 |        3 |      1 | zebra             |
| cat   |       123 |        1 |      4 | picture of cat    |
| cat   |       435 |        2 |      2 | cat memes         |
| cat   |       545 |        3 |      1 | pizza shops       |



…we would rank ‘cat’ as having a better search result ranking precision than ‘dog’ based on the correct sorting by rating.

Write a query to create a metric that can validate and rank the queries by their search result precision. Round the metric (avg_rating column) to 2 decimal places.

**Output:**


|   Column   |  Type   |
|------------|---------|
| query      | VARCHAR |
| avg_rating | FLOAT   |
