Let’s say you are managing products for an eCommerce store. You think products from  _category 9_  have a lower average price than those in all other categories.

Calculate the t-value and degrees of freedom for such a test. You do not need to calculate the p-value of the test.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`products`  table


|   Column    |  Type   |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | INTEGER |
| name        | VARCHAR |
| price       | DOUBLE  |
| category_id | INTEGER |




**Output**


| Column  |  Type   |
|---------|---------|
| t_value | DOUBLE  |
| d_o_f   | INTEGER |
