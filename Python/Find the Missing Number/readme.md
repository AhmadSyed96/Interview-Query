You have an array of integers,  `nums`  of length  `n`  spanning  `0`  to  `n`  with one missing. Write a function  `missing_number`  that returns the missing number in the array.

_Note: Complexity of O(n)  required._

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
nums = [0,1,2,4,5] 
missing_number(nums) -> 3

```
