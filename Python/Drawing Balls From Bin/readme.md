Write a function to simulate drawing balls from a jar. The colors of the balls are stored in a list named  `jar`, with corresponding counts of the balls stored in the same index in a list called  `n_balls`.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
jar = ['green', 'red', 'blue']
n_balls = [1, 10, 2]
# 1 green ball
# 10 red balls
# and 2 blue balls
```

**Output**

```
sample_multinomial(jar, n_balls) -> "blue"
```
