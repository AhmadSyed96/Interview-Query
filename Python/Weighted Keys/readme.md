Given a dictionary with weights, write a function  `random_key`  that returns a key at random with a probability proportional to the weights.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```
weights = {'A': 1, 'B': 2}

```

**Output:**

```
random_key(weights) -> return A 1/3 of the time, B 2/3 of the time

```

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```
weights = {'A': 1, 'B': 1}

```

**Output:**

```
random_key(weights) -> return A 1/2  of the time, B 1/2  of the time
```
